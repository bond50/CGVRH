                        <p>This is the first hospital strategic plan for Vihiga County Referral Hospital since its
                            inception in 2002
                            then known as Vihiga District Hospital. The formulation of this strategic plan has been an
                            elaborate and
                            consultative process involving the hospital staff, the Hospital Management Team (HMT), the
                            Hospital
                            Management Committee (HMC) and the leadership of the department of health VihigaCounty. The
                            GIZ has been an
                            instrumental partner in making the planning process a success.</p>
                        <p>The Strategic Planning Committee (SPC) carried out a situational analysis and subsequently
                            developed
                            strategic objectives in line with the Ministry of Health policies and guidelines. The plan
                            is to be
                            implemented over a five year period (2018 – 2022) with monitoring and evaluation at certain
                            points of the
                            duration. The focus of the strategic plan is to enable the hospital to operate effectively
                            as a level 5
                            referral health institution in Vihiga County and its environs. </p>
